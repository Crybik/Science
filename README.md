Installation
============
## Use the package manager pip to install foobar.

```bash
  pip install science
```


<h1> Who's us </h1>
  I'm a solo python programmer, living in jorden, owner of science package.

<h1> description </h1>
A comprehensive scientific library specialized in thermomechanics and atomic sciences, capable of establishing bonds between atoms to build chemical reactions between them and depicting them in the form of symbolic or verbal equations.
This library is a scientific library that contains a lot of functions 
that are able to help developers and some hobbyists to develop programs
related to conversion between temperatures or atomic activity 
in containing almost all the information of atoms,
which makes it powerful and able to create simple simulations of atomic activities.

> **NOTE:** this package is created by one persone, so don't be rude

# Usage

## Simpel usage
## Convert between temperature scales
```python 
    #                            From Celsius to Kelvin
    # Importing the module as sc
    import science as sc

    # Call the Kelvin function from the Temperature class
    temp = sc.Temperature.Kelvin(23, 'c')

    # Printing the result
    print(temp)
```
